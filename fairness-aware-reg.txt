Fairness
- Build matrix D (dissimiliarity), for any pair items i & j, d(i,j) = 1 if i & j are in the same state, 0 otherwise
- using ILBU (another matrix like ILD in "wasilewski")
- Implement LAPDQ + ILBU distance

notes:
- LAP-DQ, only effect the item factors, Q, user factor is unchanged
- Bassically Fairness-Aware Reg is LapDQ with ILBU distance
